     <p>What's so great about a mathematician from the Middle Ages? Fibonacci created the coolest sequence of numbers in history, where each one equals the sum of the two numbers before it (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - you get it). A thousand years since his death, people have noticed this sequence in nature, applied it in business and architecture, and created music inspired by its pattern. We think that's pretty cool!</p>
      <p>For the last 3 years, Fibonacci's has served a sequence of good food to anyone who enjoys a nerdy pun. Now we are expanding to bring you a food truck! Enjoy Fibonacci's at local events or book us for a neighborhood visit or special occasion.</p>
      <p>Fibonacci's is owned by Paula Delfino and inspired by her father Raul, a retired teacher who taught with great knowledge in the classroom and a wacky sense of humor everywhere else.</p>
